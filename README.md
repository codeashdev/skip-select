# Skip Select

A modern, responsive React application for selecting and customizing skip hire services. This project reimagines the skip selection experience with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and modern design principles.

## Development Approach

The development approach combines several modern techniques and technologies to create a polished, maintainable application:

### Component Architecture
- **Card Variants**: Multiple card styles (Standard, Animated, Glossy, Horizontal) offering different UX approaches
- **Composable Components**: Built with reusability in mind, sharing common elements while maintaining distinct visual identities
- **Atomic Design**: Structured using atomic design principles, from basic elements to complex organisms

### Styling Implementation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for rapid development and consistent design tokens
- **Glass Morphism**: Implemented modern glass effects with backdrop-blur and translucent overlays
- **Motion Design**: Framer Motion for fluid animations and micro-interactions
  - Hover effects with 3D perspective
  - Smooth transitions between states
  - Interactive card flips
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- **Theme System**: Dynamic theme switching with consistent color palettes

### User Experience
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading transitions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with helpful user feedback
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations to enhance user engagement
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant with proper ARIA attributes


### AI Assistance
 leveraged AI tools strategically to enhance development efficiency:

- **Accessibility Implementation**: Used AI to generate and validate ARIA labels and roles
- **Repetitive Tasks**: Automated routine code modifications across similar components
- **Style Consistency**: AI-powered validation of design token usage

This combination of modern development practices, thoughtful design choices, and strategic AI utilization has resulted in a highly polished, accessible, and maintainable application.
